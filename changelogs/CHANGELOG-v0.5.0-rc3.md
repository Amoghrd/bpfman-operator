Pre-release 3 for 0.5.0

The v0.5.0 release is a minor release that is the first official release with bpfman-operator in a separate repo.

A notable feature in this release is support for the BpfApplication CRD, which allows an application developer to deploy a set of required eBPF programs using a single BpfApplication CRD rather than multiple separate *Program CRDs.
